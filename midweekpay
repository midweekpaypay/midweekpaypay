Determine whether your payment history satisfies lender requirements. This means you either made a certain number of consecutive on-time loan payments of principal and interest over a certain period, such as 12, 24, or 48 months, or you prepaid the equivalent amount of principal and interest payments.
Verify whether any of your federal student loans were in a hardship, forbearance, or income-based repayment program for, say, the past 24 months.
Fill out a release application. If your payment history is solid, you can start the application process. You should be able to find a release application on the website of your lender or loan servicer.
