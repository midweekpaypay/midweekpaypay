 When a college student takes out a private student loan, it’s common for them to secure a co-signer because they lack a sufficient credit history to qualify. A co-signer, often a borrower’s relative, shares responsibility with the primary borrower for paying off a private student loan. By contrast, most federal student loans don’t allow co-signers.

Some, but not all, providers of private student loans let a borrower do this. Removal of a co-signer can happen only after the borrower has made a predetermined number of on-time payments on a private student loan and has met other requirements.
